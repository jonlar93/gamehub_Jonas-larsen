    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[i would advice the client to be carefull and only commit any secure information to sites they trust, and if going to the website they trust, trough a link be cautious to the url you are actually sent to. ]</p>
    <p>[and to have a 2fa autentication to get acces to any admin or posting priveledges for their site]</p>
    <p>[and to include automatic user timeout that involves kicking user's out of the browser if they are inactive for a brief period of time, to ensure that people arent leaving their browsers logged in when they leave, so others cant stumble uppon someone who forgot to log out, and could do damage for others in that way]</p>
    <p>[and we would implement ci/cd process that would run between every update to their site so we would check every change for security threats]</p>
    <p>[and we would implement sanitization of user inputed data, so people cant commit code trough their input and login fields.]</p>
